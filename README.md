# EmoSet-Image-Classifier

A simple model for classifying emotions in images. Fine-Tuned from https://huggingface.co/google/vit-base-patch16-224 using the [EmoSet dataset](https://github.com/JingyuanYY/EmoSet).

3 Zero-Shot image classification models were also tested as a baseline: CLIP-ViT-B-16, BLIP-Base, and ALBEF-Base. Credits to [LaVis](https://github.com/salesforce/LAVIS).

Training is ongoing- updated checkpoints will be posted as available.
